[**ilqc**](https://github.com/vroulet/ilqc)  
A toolbox for analyzing non-linear control algorithms from an optimization perspective.
* Compare convergence of algos for exact/risk-sensitive formulations
* Oracles implemented Ã  la Pytorch
* Comparisons on synthetic/realistic problems

[**casimir**](https://github.com/krishnap25/casimir)  
A toolbox of selected optimization algorithms for unstructured tasks such as binary classification, and structured prediction tasks such as visual object localization and named entity recognition.

[**yesweckn**](https://github.com/cjones6/yesweckn)  
A code to implement Convolutional Kernel Networks (CKNs) on image classification tasks. CKNs are the translation of Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) into the framework of kernel methods. The present code provides a concrete implementation of this framework on benchmark architectures and datasets.
