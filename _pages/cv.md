I did my PhD at the Ecole Normale Superieure de Paris and INRIA under the supervision of Alexandre d'Aspremont in the SIERRA team led by Francis Bach. Before my PhD, I was a student at the Ecole Polytechnique where I got my engineering degree. There, I specialized in Machine Learning in the master Math√©matiques, Vision et Apprentissage at ENS Cachan and Telecom ParisTech. Apart from research, I'm fond of music, I play bass and I animated the music association of my university. More details can be found in my [CV](/files/vroulet_cv.pdf).
