I am an acting instructor in the Department of Statistics of the University of Washington.

Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow in the Institute for Foundations of Data Science (formerly [ADSI](http://ads-institute.uw.edu/)) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/).

I received my Ph.D. from [Ecole Normale Superieure Ulm](http://www.ens.fr) under the supervision of [Alexandre d'Aspremont](http://www.di.ens.fr/~aspremon/) within the [Sierra Team](http://www.di.ens.fr/sierra) led by [Francis Bach](http://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/).

During my thesis, I demonstrated both theoretically and empirically how accelerated algorithms for convex optimization can be sped-up by restarts. I established the link between the resulting speed-up and the problem's statistical properties in sparse recovery applications. During my Postdoc, I developed regularized and accelerated variants of non-linear off-line control algorithms for finite trajectories with theoretical guarantees of convergence. I extended the approach for non-linear risk-sensitive control problems based on the identification of a surrogate cost.
