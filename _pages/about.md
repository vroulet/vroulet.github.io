I am an acting assistant professor in the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.uw.edu/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/).
Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow in the NSF-TRIPODS institute [ADSI](http://ads-institute.uw.edu/) (now [IFDS](https://ifds.info/)) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/).
I received my Ph.D. from [Ecole Normale Superieure de Paris](http://www.ens.fr) under the supervision of [Alexandre d'Aspremont](http://www.di.ens.fr/~aspremon/) within the [Sierra Team](http://www.di.ens.fr/sierra) led by [Francis Bach](http://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/).

I am currently interested in discrete-time nonlinear control from an optimization viewpoint.
