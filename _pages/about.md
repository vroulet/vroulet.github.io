I am a postdoctoral fellow in the [Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.washington.edu) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/) working with the [ADSI](http://ads-institute.uw.edu/) members [Zaid Harchaoui](http://faculty.washington.edu/zaid), [Dmitriy Drusvyatskiy](http://sites.math.washington.edu/~ddrusv/), [Maryam Fazel](https://faculty.washington.edu/mfazel/), [Sham Kakade](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~sham/),  [Yin Tat Lee](http://yintat.com/).

I've got my Ph.D. from [Ecole Normale Superieure Ulm](http://www.ens.fr) under the supervision of [Alexandre d'Aspremont](http://www.di.ens.fr/~aspremon/) within the [Sierra Team](http://www.di.ens.fr/sierra) led by [Francis Bach](http://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/).

During my thesis, I worked on mathematical optimization approaches for data science problems with an underlying combinatorial structure and on the acceleration of optimization algorithms by restarts. I am now interested in non-linear control from an optimization perspective.
