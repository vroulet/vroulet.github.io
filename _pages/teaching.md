## Lecturer  
**Probability II**,  *Spring 2020.*  
*University of Washington, Seattle.*  
Random variables; expectation and variance; laws of large numbers; normal approximation and
other limit theorems; multidimensional distributions and transformations.  

**Statistical Learning**,  *Winter 2020.*  
*University of Washington, Seattle.*  
Reviews optimization and convex optimization in its relation to statistics. Covers the basics
of unconstrained and constrained convex optimization, basics of clustering and classification,
entropy, KL divergence and exponential family models, duality, modern learning algorithms like
boosting, support vector machines, and variational approximations in inference.

## Teaching Assistant  
**Convex Optimization**,  *2014-2017.*   
*Master Mathematics, Vision, Learning, École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay, Paris.*

## Tutorials  
**Automatic Differentiation**,  *May 2019.*  
*Statistical Machine Learning for Data Scientists, University of Washington, Seattle.*     
Lecture on automatic differentiation with code examples covering: how to compute gradients of
a chain of computations, how to use automatic-differentiation software, how to use automatic-
differentiation beyond gradient computations.

**Optimization for deep learning**,  *Jul. 2018.*  
*Summer School on Fundamentals of Data Analysis,University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison.*    
Interactive Jupyter Notebook for 30 attendees to understand the basics of optimization for
deep learning: automatic-differentiation, convergence guarantees of SGD, illustration of the
batch-normalization effect.
